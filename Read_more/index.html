                            I’ve
                            attended
                            as a full-time designer; in retrospect, this was admittedly an amazing introductory
                            experience.
                            From the
                            first time I landed on the website, I was already impressed by the high attention-to-detail
                            the
                            organizers put into this initiative. The talented speakers, diversity in talks, and the
                            quality
                            of
                            presentations refocused the needle of my career map and elevated the bar for the quality of

                            I want
                            to produce in future years. It was very inspiring to see stunning reels from the best
                            agencies
                            and

                            Attending a conference abroad in Tokyo offered a unique experience hard to replicate
                            elsewhere.
                            The
                            large majority of the audience and speakers were Japanese and being exposed to their culture
                            and
                            approach to design was incredibly inspiring. It reflected, to me, the fact that design is a
                            universal
                            field that surpasses language barriers. With translation tools, we were able to come
                            together in
                            learning from our multi-tongued array of speakers.
